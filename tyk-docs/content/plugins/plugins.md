Tyk supports the use of the following plugins to extend Tyk functionality:

*   [Python, Lua, gRPC (Rich Plugins)](/plugins/supported-languages/rich-plugins/)
*   [JavaScript Plugins](/plugins/supported-languages/javascript-middleware/) (JSVM Middleware)
*   [Golang native plugins](/plugins/supported-languages/golang/)

inside the following areas of the API Request Lifecycle

*   [Authentication Plugins](/plugins/auth-plugins/)
*   [Request Plugins](/plugins/request-plugins/)
*   [Response Plugins](/plugins/response-plugins/)

### Plugin Caveats

*   They must run as a single process.
*   The plugins used *must* be specified in an API definition and are not global across APIs.
*   They must manage API-specific cases in the same process, only one CoProcess will be managed by a Tyk Instance.
